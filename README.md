Back-ground Story

ers a wide range of products
and services to the customers around the globe with a strong reputation in the industry

ering exceptional and unique global digital customer service and delivering
top-quality hardware products, which has rewarded them as a Sustained and committed
customer base . Recently in their 12’th anniversary , Their aim is to create a
contemporary and Flexible Data infrastructure model capable of managing the expanding
data volume and accommodating the development of their business.Because in a survey
, many employees claim that they are having great di

culty in handling the growing
amount of data, which is causing their data queries and reports to take longer to
process and On occasion, the system may generate inaccurate outcomes.
. An employee named Roumi recently connected with me on the ZOOM platform and
explained to me the whole issue. As a database management expert, I have been asked to
build an RDBMS system for building a modern digital platform and making a scalable
database management system so that they can support their company’s growing
business and reputation . My objective was to ensure that their system can
accommodate their company's expanding business needs, while also providing accurate,
reliable, and easily accessible data in their digital online platform.
